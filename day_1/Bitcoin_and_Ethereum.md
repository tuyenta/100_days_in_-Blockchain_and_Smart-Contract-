## Smart Contracts and Hybrid Smart Contracts
A smart contract is a computer code that can be built into the blockchain to facilitate, verify, or negotiate a contract agreement. Smart contracts operate under a set of conditions to which users agree. When those conditions are met, the terms of the agreement are automatically carried out.

### Blockchain Oracles

### Consensus
In a blockchain, to validate new entries or records to a block, a majority of the decentralized networkâ€™s computing power would need to agree to it. To prevent bad actors from validating bad transactions or double spends, blockchains are secured by a consensus mechanism such as proof of work ([PoW](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/)) or proof of stake ([PoS](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/)). These mechanisms allow for agreement even when no single node is in charge.

## Making Your First Transaction
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
- [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)
- [Rinkeby Etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)
- [Kovan Etherscan](https://kovan.etherscan.io/)
- Rinkeby Faucet (Check the [link token contracts page](https://docs.chain.link/docs/link-token-contracts/#rinkeby))
  - NOTE: The Chainlink documentation always has the most up to date faucets on their [link token contracts page](https://docs.chain.link/docs/link-token-contracts/#rinkeby). If the faucet above is broken, check the chainlink documentation for the most up to date faucet.
- OR, use the [Kovan ETH Faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/), just be sure to swap your metamask to kovan!
